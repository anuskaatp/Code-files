 <!-- Number System Section --> 
 <div class="section"> 
 <h2>Number System in Computers</h2> 
 <p>The number system in computers is based on different numeral systems that represent  data and information. Commonly used number systems in computing include:</p> 
 <ul> 
 <li><strong>Binary (Base-2):</strong> Uses two digits, 0 and 1. The most fundamental  number system used in computers.</li> 
 <li><strong>Octal (Base-8):</strong> Uses digits 0-7. It is a shorthand way to represent  binary numbers.</li> 
 <li><strong>Hexadecimal (Base-16):</strong> Uses digits 0-9 and letters A-F to  represent values. It's a compact way to represent binary data.</li> 
 <li><strong>Decimal (Base-10):</strong> The number system humans use, consisting  of digits 0-9.</li> 
 </ul>

 <!-- 1's and 2's Complement Section --> 
 <div class="section"> 
 <h2>1's and 2's Complement</h2> 
 <p>The <strong>1's complement</strong> and <strong>2's complement</strong> are  methods for representing negative binary numbers. These are commonly used in computers for  performing arithmetic operations with signed numbers.</p> 
 <h3>1's Complement</h3> 
 <p>In the 1's complement method, to find the complement of a binary number, you simply  flip all the bits (change 1 to 0 and 0 to 1).</p> 
 <p><strong>Example:</strong> The 1's complement of <code>1010</code> is  <code>0101</code>.</p> 
 <h3>2's Complement</h3> 
 <p>The 2's complement is obtained by first finding the 1's complement of the binary  number, then adding 1 to the least significant bit (LSB) of the result.</p> 
 <p><strong>Example:</strong> To find the 2's complement of <code>1010</code>:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>1's complement of <code>1010</code> is <code>0101</code>.</li>  <li>Adding 1 to the LSB: <code>0101 + 1 = 0110</code>.</li>  </ul> 
 <p>Thus, the 2's complement of <code>1010</code> is <code>0110</code>.</p>

 <!-- Logic Gates Section --> 
 <div class="section"> 
 <h2>Logic Gates</h2> 
 <p>Logic gates are the basic building blocks of digital circuits, which perform logical  operations on one or more binary inputs to produce a single output. The most common logic gates  are:</p> 
 <ul> 
 <li><strong>AND Gate:</strong> The output is 1 only if both inputs are 1.</li>  <li><strong>OR Gate:</strong> The output is 1 if at least one input is 1.</li>  <li><strong>NOT Gate:</strong> The output is the inverse (opposite) of the input.</li>  <li><strong>NAND Gate:</strong> The output is 0 only if both inputs are 1 (NOT  AND).</li> 
 <li><strong>NOR Gate:</strong> The output is 0 if at least one input is 1 (NOT  OR).</li> 
 <li><strong>XOR Gate:</strong> The output is 1 if the inputs are different (exclusive  OR).</li> 
 <li><strong>XNOR Gate:</strong> The output is 1 if the inputs are the same (exclusive  NOT OR).</li> 
 </ul>
